# Simple-linear-regression
A simple linear regression that predicts salary based on the years of experience of an employee. 

INTRODUCTION
Linear regression is a method of predictive analysis used to find out the value of the dependent variable with the help of an independent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that describes the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable.

Today, we will learn how linear regression analysis works with the help of a very simple example. We will predict the salary of a worker based on the individual's years of experience. To predict this we are going to use a salary dataset that has a column titled YearsExperience and another titled Salary. Then, you will use a Linear Regression algorithm to find the best-fit line that describes the relationship between the number of Years Experience and Salary. Once you have the best-fit line, you can use it to predict how much Salary will be paid.
